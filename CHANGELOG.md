### Version k1.0.0 (in progress)

**Independent fork line + text-first rework.** Diverged from upstream after the
1.7.x base. The legacy flat modules (`codesys_*.pyw`) still drive the running
tool while the new `cds/` package is being built out per `docs/REWORK_PLAN.md`.

- **Versioning**: fork uses a `k` prefix, tracked independently from upstream.
- **`cds/core`**: pure-Python, CI-tested layer — canonical `.st`/property text
  format, type inference, disk<->object reader/writer, diff, and hash cache.
- **In progress**: the native-snapshot seam (`cds/core/model`, `cds/core/patch`)
  and the `cds/ide` layer; legacy modules are removed only once these are
  verified against a real CODESYS IDE.

### Version 1.7.3 (2026-04-02)

**Move/Rename Detection & Stale File Cleanup:**

- **Moved File Detection**: Implemented smart detection of renamed/moved project files by cross-referencing IDE orphan objects with disk orphan files using base filename matching.
- **Automatic Path Invalidation**: Enhanced cache invalidation logic to detect when objects are moved/renamed in the IDE, ensuring stale cached paths are refreshed during comparison.
- **Stale File Cleanup**: Added automatic removal of old files from disk during export when objects have been moved/renamed in the IDE, preventing orphaned files from cluttering the sync directory.
- **UI Enhancements**: Updated comparison dialog to display moved files with their old (IDE) and new (Disk) paths, using `~moved` visual indicator.
- **Import/Export Move Handling**: Added logic to physically move objects within the IDE during import when path mismatches are detected, ensuring project structure stays synchronized.
- **Statistics Update**: Moved object count now reported in comparison summary (`~:` prefix) and import/export completion messages.

### Version 1.7.2 (2026-03-28)

**Critical Fixes & UX Optimization:**

- **Module Import Fix**: Resolved a critical `ImportError` where `codesys_ui` was not being loaded in `Project_directory.py`, causing a crash on startup for new projects.
- **Reference Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed an undefined variable crash (`choice[0]`) in `Project_directory.py`.
  - Fixed an undefined variable crash (`result[0]`) in `Project_export.py` during orphaned file cleanup.

### Version 1.7.1 (2026-03-27)

**UI Robustness & Post-Sync Enhancements:**

- **Standard Windows Prompts**: Replaced the unreliable native CODESYS `system.ui.choose` radio-button dialogs with standard Windows MessageBox dialogs (`ask_yes_no`, `ask_yes_no_cancel`) across all scripts.
- **Cancel Button Fix**: Completely resolved an issue where clicking "Cancel" or closing dialogue windows would fail to halt script execution due to inconsistent CODESYS API return types.
- **Import Final Confirmation**: Added an explicit final summary dialog (`Ready to import X changes into the IDE... Proceed?`) right before applying structural changes or deletions in `Project_import.py`.
- **Auto-Save & Workflow**:
  - Introduced optional automatic project saving and binary backup after an export is completed.
  - Added a new 'Save Project after Export' toggle in the Configuration UI (`Project_parameters.py`).
  - Centralized version compatibility checks, safety backups, and post-sync operations into `codesys_utils.pyw` for cleaner architecture and standardized execution.

### Version 1.7.0 (2026-03-27)

**Merkle Tree & High-Performance Sync Overhaul:**

- **Lightning-Fast Comparison**: Total sync/compare time reduced by ~90% (sub-10s for large projects) using a new Merkle Tree-based hierarchical hashing strategy.
- **Intelligent Path/Type Caching**:
  - Implemented GUID-based caching for object classification and filesystem paths in `sync_cache.json`.
  - Eliminates thousands of slow CODESYS COM API calls (`classify_object`, `get_children`, `build_expected_path`) on repeat runs.
- **Hierarchical Merkle Skips**: The comparison engine now uses folder hashes to skip entire unchanged branches of the project tree instantly.
- **Import Optimization**:
  - Eliminated redundant double-save operations during import/backup, reducing the post-import pause by 50%.
  - Optimized POU child restoration and metadata handling.
- **Hybrid XML Hashing**: Integrated last-known XML hashes into Pass 1 so folders containing mixed ST and XML objects can still benefit from Merkle Tree skips.
- **Integrated Accessor Collection**: Merged property accessor scanning into the main object pass to avoid redundant project-wide traversals.
- **Profiling Tool Upgrade**: Updated `Project_perf_test.py` with the new architecture to provide accurate real-world metrics, including cache hit ratios and Merkle skip statistics.

### Version 1.6.7 (2026-03-25)

**Silent Mode Removal & Backup Enhancement:**

- **Removed Silent Mode**: All `silent` parameters have been removed from `Project_import.py`, `Project_export.py`, `Project_compare.py`, and `Project_Build.py`. Scripts now consistently use modal dialogs for all user feedback.
- **Unified UI Behavior**: All operations now use modal dialogs (`system.ui.info` / `system.ui.error`) in interactive mode, eliminating the previous inconsistent behavior.
- **Version Compatibility Checks**: All version compatibility checks now always prompt the user when version mismatches occur, rather than silently logging warnings or ignoring the issue.
- **Timestamped Backup with Retention**: Enhanced import backup functionality with automatic retention policy:
  - **codesys_utils.pyw**: Added `cleanup_old_backups()` function to automatically delete old timestamped backups while preserving non-timestamped Git LFS backups
  - **Enhanced Backup Function**: `backup_project_binary()` now accepts `retention_count` parameter and returns the backup filename on success
  - **UI Enhancement**: Added "Max Backups to Keep (Optional)" field in settings dialog (default: 10, minimum: 1)
  - **Persistent Settings**: Added `cds-sync-backup-retention-count` property to Project_parameters.py for cross-run persistence
  - **Import Scripts**: Both `Project_import.py` and `Project_compare.py` now create timestamped backups before import operations when changes exist
  - **Backup Reports**: Import completion reports now show backup confirmation message when safety backups are created
  - **Cleanup Pattern**: Only timestamped `.bak` files matching pattern `^\d{8}_\d{6}_.*\.bak$` are subject to cleanup; non-timestamped backup files are preserved

### Version 1.6.6 (2026-03-18)

**Resource Analysis UI Enhancement:**

- **Interactive Results Dialog**: `Project_resources.py` now displays results in a modern Windows Forms dialog instead of console output.
- **Sortable Data Grid**: Click column headers to sort by Object Name, Type, Size, or Category.
- **Full Object List**: Shows all analyzed objects with scrolling support (previously limited to top 30).
- **Summary Panel**: Displays Total Code, Total XML, and Object count at the bottom.
- **Fallback Support**: Console output still works if UI components are unavailable.

---

### Version 1.6.5 (2026-03-17)

**Interface Export Support:**

- **Interface Objects**: Added full support for exporting and importing `INTERFACE` objects with their `EXTENDS` clauses preserved.
- **Interface Methods**: Interface methods/properties now export as flat files (`InterfaceName.Method.st`) matching the existing FB pattern.
- **Native XML Fallback**: Added `export_interface_declaration()` function that extracts interface declarations via native XML export when `textual_declaration` is unavailable.
- **Updated Type GUIDs**: Corrected interface type GUID to `6654496c-404d-479a-aad2-8551054e5f1e` and added `itf_method` GUID for interface members.

---

### Version 1.6.4 (2026-03-12)

**UI Cleanup & Module Security:**

- **Hidden Internal Modules**: Renamed all `codesys_*.py` files to `.pyw` extension. This hides them from the CODESYS Script Engine menu, providing a cleaner user interface that only shows primary `Project_*.py` commands.
- **Custom Module Loader**: Implemented a robust `_load_hidden_module` mechanism in all entry scripts to handle `.pyw` imports with proper dependency ordering.
- **Deprecated Scripts Cleanup**: Removed several unused and debug scripts (`debug_metadata.py`, `Project_Daemon.py`) to streamline the repository.

---

### Version 1.6.3 (2026-03-07)

**Version Tracking & Compatibility Detection:**

- **Single Source of Truth**: Added `SCRIPT_VERSION = "1.6.3"` in `codesys_constants.py` as the central version reference for all scripts.
- **Dual Storage Strategy**:
  - **sync_metadata.json**: Metadata file stored in export directory containing script version, last action (export/import), timestamp, duration, and statistics.
  - **Project Property**: Version also saved to CODESYS project property (`cds-sync-version`) for runtime compatibility checks.
- **Import/Compare Warnings**: Both `Project_import.py` and `Project_compare.py` now detect version mismatches and display warnings without blocking operations (User can continue at their own risk).
- **Improved Audit Trail**: Each export and import operation updates `sync_metadata.json` with current script version, making it easy to identify which scripts were used for operations.
- **Git Integration**: The `sync_metadata.json` file is now tracked in version control, enabling teams to see export/import history.

### Version 1.6.2 (2026-03-04)

**XML Import & Object Structure Enhancements:**

- **POU Child Management**: Implemented saving and restoring of POU children during the XML import process to maintain project hierarchy.
- **Parent Lookup**: Enhanced parent POU lookup logic during object creation for improved structural accuracy.
- **Empty Implementation Handling**: Ensured that implementation markers are always present for specific object types, even if their implementation is empty (addressing issues where empty methods or properties might be skipped).

### Version 1.6.1 (2026-02-26)

**Orphan Deletion & Stability Enhancements:**

- **Bi-directional Orphan Management**:
  - **IDE-to-Disk (Sync/Export)**: Existing logic in `Project_export.py` continues to clean up files on disk that are missing in the IDE.
  - **Disk-to-IDE (Import)**: `Project_import.py` now supports deleting objects from the IDE if they were removed on disk (e.g., from a Git pull). The "Disk wins" principle is now fully enforced.
- **Improved Comparison UI**:
  - The Interactive Results dialog now clearly identifies objects missing on disk as **"Missing on Disk (DELETE from IDE?)"**.
  - Importing these items will now safely remove them from the CODESYS project tree.
- **Hardware Stability (Device Exclusion)**:
  - Hard-excluded `device` and `device_module` objects from the synchronization engine.
  - Syncing these components via XML was found to be unstable (can lead to tree reconstruction and project "emptying").
  - Users should configure hardware manually and sync the application logic.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed an issue where the import process could fail to report the correct number of updated/created items when deletions were involved.
  - Updated default `.gitignore` template to include `*.device` and `*.device_xml` patterns as a safety measure.

### Version 1.6 (2026-02-24)

**Core Engine Refactoring & Interactive Sync:**

- **Multi-PLC & Multi-Application Support**: The engine now automatically handles complex project hierarchies, organizing exports into a clear `Device/Application/Folder` structure (essential for modern CODESYS projects).
- **Metadata-Free Sync Engine**: Significant refactoring to transition from metadata files (`_metadata.csv`, `_config.json`) to a direct, hash-based two-way comparison between the CODESYS IDE and disk. This improves reliability when moving projects between machines or using Git.
- **Interactive Comparison Dialog**: `Project_compare.py` now includes an interactive results window where you can selectively apply changes (Import or Export) directly from the diff list.
- **Project Discovery Tool**: New `Project_discover.py` script for mapping the project tree structure and diagnosing supported block types (logs findings to `sync_debug.log`).
- **Maintenance**: `Project_daemon.py` has been temporarily disabled.
- **Improved Comparison Logic**: Better handling of graphical POUs and XML-based objects (Visualizations, Task Configurations) in the comparison engine.

### Version 1.5.6.1 (2026-02-21)

### Version 1.5.6 (2026-02-18)

**Safety Net: Timestamped Import Backups:**

- **Automatic Rollback Point**: `Project_import.py` now creates a timestamped backup (e.g., `20260218_220000_MyProject.project.bak`) at the very beginning of the import process.
- **Configurable Safety**: Added "Timestamped Backup before Import" toggle in `Project_parameters.py` (enabled by default).
- **Non-destructive**: These backups are placed in the `/project` folder and use a `.bak` extension to avoid conflict with your primary Git LFS tracking.

### Version 1.5.5 (2026-02-18)

**Relative Path Support for Team Collaboration:**

- **Portable Project Configuration**: `Project_directory.py` now supports relative paths (e.g., `./`, `./folderName/`) in addition to absolute paths.
- **Manual Path Input**: Added a new "Manual Input" option in the directory setup dialog, allowing users to type paths directly.
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: If a specified directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
- **Team-Friendly**: Relative paths are resolved relative to the project file location, making projects portable across different machines and users without reconfiguration.
- **Examples**:
  - `./` - Sync to project directory
  - `./sync/` - Sync to a subfolder
  - `C:\MySync\` - Traditional absolute path still supported

### Version 1.5.4 (2026-02-16)

**Comparison Logging & Rerouting:**

- **Dedicated Comparison Log**: `Project_compare.py` now reroutes its output to `compare.log` in the sync directory.
- **Recreative Logging**: The log file is truncated and recreated on every run, providing a fresh report for each comparison.
- **Tee Output**: Comparison results are still mirrored to the CODESYS Script Output window for immediate feedback.

### Version 1.5.3 (2026-02-16)

**Line Ending & Git Consistency Fix:**

- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Fixed an issue where different line endings (CRLF vs LF) on different machines caused Git to show identical files as modified.
- **Deterministic Export**: The export script now explicitly uses LF (`\n`) for all `.st` files regardless of the host OS by using `newline=''` in file operations.
- **Automated Git Configuration**: Updated the `.gitattributes` template to automatically disable text conversion for `.st` files (`*.st -text`), ensuring they remain as LF in the repository and are treated consistently by Git on all platforms.

### Version 1.5.2 (2026-02-15)

**Improved Property Sync & Bug Fixes:**

- **Enhanced Property Support**: Properties with combined GET/SET accessors are now correctly handled. The export script now accurately combines both the `VAR` declaration and implementation code for each accessor into a single `.st` file.
- **Bi-directional Accessor Sync**: The import script now correctly parses combined accessor content and updates both the declaration and implementation in CODESYS.
- **Object Restoration**: Fixed an issue where objects deleted from CODESYS but remaining on disk would not be recreated. They are now automatically detected and restored during import.
- **Bug Fix (#4)**: Resolved an issue where properties created manually in external editors (or by AI) were incorrectly identified or failed to import.

### Version 1.5.1 (2026-02-15)

**Performance & Optimization Update:**

- **CRC32 Hashing**: Switched from SHA256 to CRC32 for file tracking, achieving **10-20x faster** hashing performance and significantly reducing metadata size.

### Version 1.5.0 (2026-02-13)

**The "Power User" Update:**

- **Project_Daemon.py**: New background service with Global Hotkey (`Alt + Q`).
- **Quick Action Dashboard**: Instant access to Export, Import, Build, and Backup commands.
- **Enhanced Build Log**: `Project_Build.py` now generates a clean, readable table format in `build.log` with accurate line numbers for external editors.
- **Focus Management**: Daemon correctly handles focus switching between Virtual Desktops and restores context after execution.

### Version 1.4.0 (2026-02-12)

**UI & Experience Overhaul:**

- **Configuration Dialog**: Replaced the text-based menu with a modern Windows Forms dialog for easier configuration.
- **Silent Mode**: Added a "Silent Mode" option that uses non-blocking system tray notifications (toasts) instead of blocking popups.
- **Safety**: Added checks to prevent sync on wrong machine (PC Name check).

### Version 1.3.0 (2026-02-09)

**Binary Backup & Configuration Overhaul:**

- **Project_parameters.py**: New interactive menu to toggle features.
- **Binary Backup**: Added optional `.project` file backup loop. The binary is now updated on both Export and Import events.
- **Logging**: Moved `sync_debug.log` to the project sync folder (or Temp) to keep `ScriptDir` clean.
- **Import Logic**: Removed interactive menu from Import script; now uses project settings.

### Version 1.2.0 (2026-02-09)

**Safety & Validation:**

- **PC Check**: Validates `cds-sync-pc` to prevent syncing on the wrong machine.
- **Properties**: All settings are now stored in Project Properties (`cds-sync-*`).

### Version 1.0.0 - 1.1.0

- Full support for nested folders.
- Detection of deletions (Orphan cleanup).
- Library version tracking (`_libraries.csv`).
